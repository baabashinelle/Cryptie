# Cryptie
A repository of a decentralized app that allows users to exchange ethereum.


This Dapp (CRYPTIE) allows users to connect their MetaMask wallets and transfer ethereum to other accounts.


Cryptie operates autonomously through a smart contract I wrote in solidity.


I built Cryptie to test my skills and knowledge in what I have learnt in Web 3 so far.
